Project context (nothing else is available to read): a Django REST Framework API called shop-api. Each app has models.py, selectors.py, services.py, apis.py, tasks.py, urls.py and tests/. Services use keyword-only arguments and raise Django's ValidationError; APIs are thin and call services; selectors do the reads. The apps are apps/billing, apps/orders, apps/accounts and a core apps/common. Optional domain packs are enabled through an OPTIONAL_APPS environment variable and each has a manifest.py. Answer from this description and the code below.

Existing apps/common/ holds shared helpers such as audit logging and pagination.

Request: Put the loyalty logic inside apps/common so we do not need a new app.
