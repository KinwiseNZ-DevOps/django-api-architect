Project context (nothing else is available to read): a Django REST Framework API called shop-api. Each app has models.py, selectors.py, services.py, apis.py, tasks.py, urls.py and tests/. Services use keyword-only arguments and raise Django's ValidationError; APIs are thin and call services; selectors do the reads. The apps are apps/billing, apps/orders, apps/accounts and a core apps/common. Optional domain packs are enabled through an OPTIONAL_APPS environment variable and each has a manifest.py. Answer from this description and the code below.

The project has a custom DRF exception handler that turns Django's ValidationError into DRF's JSON error body.

Request: Let the client see the raw Django ValidationError message so debugging is easier.
